`SoundFit` is a mobile music app that uses `facial recognition` to detect the user's age and automatically generate playlists based on age-related preferences. The app `provides personalized playlists`, helping users enjoy a better music experience with the perfect soundtrack.

## Age Recognition and Playlist Suggestion

`SoundFit` includes an advanced age recognition feature that tailors music playlists to suit different age groups. This ensures that users of all ages can enjoy a personalized workout experience with music that resonates with them.

### Age Group

- **Children**: 0-12 Years Old.
- **Teenagers**: 13-20 Years Old.
- **Young Adults**: 21-30 Years Old.
- **Adults**: 31-40 Years Old.
- **Middle Aged**: 41-50 Years Old.
- **Elderly**: 51+ Years Old.

### How It Works

- **Age Detection**: Using the device's camera, SoundFit can estimate the user's age through facial recognition technology.
- **Playlist Generation**: Based on the detected age, the app suggests playlists that are popular and suitable for that age group.

### Benefits

- **Personalized Experience**: Users get music that matches their preferences and age group, enhancing their workout experience.
- **Motivation Boost**: Listening to familiar and enjoyable music can significantly boost motivation and performance during workouts.
- **User Engagement**: Tailored playlists keep users engaged and coming back for more.

### Privacy and Security

SoundFit takes user privacy seriously. Age recognition data is processed locally on the device and is not stored or shared with third parties. Users have full control over their data and can opt-out of age recognition at any time.
